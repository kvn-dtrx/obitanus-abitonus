# Obitanus Abitonus

## Synopsis

This repository contains a simple LaTeX template for obituaries.

**NOTE:** Compiled PDF versions of this template are provided in the [Releases](https://github.com/kvn-dtrx/abitonus-abitanus/releases) section for the purpose of preview.

### Nomen est nomen …

The term *Obitanus Abitonus* originates from the ludic Latin proverb "Obit anus, abit onus"; its popularisation appears to be mainly associated with the German philosopher [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer). As one might guess, the word *obituary* derives also from *obire*.

## Preliminaries
