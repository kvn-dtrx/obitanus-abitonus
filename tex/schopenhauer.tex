    dictum={Death is the result, the resumé of life, or the total sum expressing, in a single stroke, the whole lesson that life has imparted sporadically and piecemeal: and the lesson is this, that the entirety of striving, the appearance of which is life, was futile, in vain, and contradictory, and it is a redemption to be returned from it. As the whole, slow vegetation of the plant is to the fruit, which in a single stroke accomplishes a hundred times over what the plant achieved slowly and bit by bit---so life, with its obstacles, disappointed hopes, frustrated plans, and steady suffering, is to death, which, in a single stroke, destroys everything a person has willed, thereby crowning the teachings of life.
